== Other airports and scenery details ==

This package includes two more airports, LIPR and LIDF, that are being
developed in 850 apt.dat format. It might get to include other smaller airfields
in the region.

Some shared objects were also placed around Ancona. Note that those are quite
experimental. Terrain was generated with SRTM-3, Corine Landcover, OSM data.
